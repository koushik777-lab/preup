![](https://shivasadhana.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Pind-Daan-Services-in-Varanasi.jpg)

Pind Daan in Varanasi is considered as the path of salvation and it is believed that ancestors get ultimate satisfaction if pind daan is performed at Kashi. The city is known for many Pundits and Acharayas who are expert in Pind daan and other related rituals. Pinddaan in Banaras is generally performed at the Ganga Ghats. We provide excellent packages for travel as well as Pinddaan in the city where our pandas ensure that your prayers reach the destination as they guide you with the correct vidhi as you carry out your responsibility for the deceased souls of your family members.

## Who Can Perform Pind Daan in Varanasi?

Gayaji Pind Daan or Brahma kapal Pind Daan is generally performed by eldest son of the family but in case there is no male member available in the family, females can also perform the rituals. It is believed that Sita mata from Ramayana had done gaya ji pind daan for king Dashratha.

Pind Daan is an important ritual for all who wish to honour their ancestors and seek their blessings. It is believed that performing this ritual in Varanasi can help the departed souls attain Moksha or liberation. While the exact process of Pind Daan may vary depending on the region, community, and family customs, the essence remains the same: to show respect and gratitude to the ancestors and seek their blessings for a peaceful and prosperous life.

## Procedure in Varanasi Pind Daan

While performing the ritual on the first day, the devotees should take a holy bath in the Ganga and one has to give Sankalp, Guruvarn & barni,

before¬†performing Pooja. When you do online booking of Pind Daan in Varanasi, Anthyesti will take care of Pandit arrangement according to your requirement

and along with the samagri which is required for Pind daan.

Our scriptures have specified the punishment of not performing Shradh. There are two major steps of Shradh in Varanasi. 1. Performing Pind Daan and 2.¬†Brahmin Bhojan in Varanasi. The person performing shradh should perform with complete devotion by understanding the nature of shradh. By performing all these pujas the departed soul will receive food and water for him. In the scriptures all our veda have advised us to perform the Varanasi pind daan.

When the deceased body is taken to the funeral pyre, six pindas are offered in order to satisfy gods who are responsible in the earth to avoid negative energie and evil spirits. From here departed soul new journey will begin. While in the journey Souls water and food will be required. These requirements will be fulfilled by the Pind Daan offered on Uttamshodasi. The Journey departed soul becomes worse if the relatives do not offer Pind Daan in Varanasi.

Saying a final goodbye to your desist loved one is very important for you to move on in life. Some also believe that it allows the soul to find peace in the other world.By Shiva Sadhana Group√ó
