## Our Mission

**At Shiva Sadhana, our mission is to reconnect people with the roots of spirituality, tradition, and conscious living by offering soulful journeys, sacred products, and holistic experiences. We strive to preserve and promote the divine essence of sacred places like Varanasi, Banaras, and Ayodhya, while supporting spiritual seekers, travelers, and local communities through authentic services—ranging from spiritual kits and organic products to peaceful retreats and warm hospitality. With devotion and dedication, we aim to be a bridge between faith and fulfillment, tradition and tourism, and India’s spiritual heritage and the world.**

**We also offer international spiritual tours, meditation retreats in Varanasi, and traditional rituals like Shraddha Kriya, ensuring every soul finds connection, peace, and purpose on their journey.**

### **Founder’s Message – Pankaj Shetti**

         “I founded **Shiva Sadhana** with a simple vision — to help people reconnect with their soul, their purpose, and the peace within. In today’s fast-moving world, we often   forget to pause, breathe, and look inward. Through this platform, I aim to offer  experiences that are not just spiritual, but also healing and life-transforming.

          Whether you’re joining us for a **meditation retreat,** exploring India through   our **travel packages,** or simply seeking peace in our **spiritual hostels,** you are a part of our family. Shiva Sadhana is not just a service — it’s a **journey of awakening.**

I welcome you to walk this path with us.”

**— Pankaj Shetti,**
